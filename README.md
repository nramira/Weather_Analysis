## Data Source:
The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) [Global Historical Climatology Network daily (GHCNd)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily) (GHCN-Daily).

## Columns Info:
1. STATION = The station identification code.
2. DATE = The year of the record (4 digits) followed by month (2 digits) and day (2 digits).
3. PRCP = Precipitation (mm).
4. SNWD = Snow depth (mm).
5. TMAX = Maximum temperature (celsius).
6. TMIN = Minimum temperature (celsius).

## Objective:
The particular dataset we are working with is comprised of daily climate records from various land surface stations across Berlin from 2010 to 2020. We are looking for
extreme temperatures in 2020 compared to records from the previous decade. We will visualize this results using Matplotlib tools.
